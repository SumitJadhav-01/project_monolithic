Project Title: Monolithic Application Deployment Using CI/CD Pipelines
Objective
To deploy a monolithic web application on a Tomcat server using an automated CI/CD pipeline. The project incorporates modern DevOps tools and practices to streamline infrastructure provisioning, build automation, artifact management, and application monitoring.

Project Overview
This project demonstrates:
1.	Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Automated provisioning of cloud infrastructure using Terraform.
2.	Build Automation: Efficiently compiling and packaging the application with Maven.
3.	CI/CD Pipeline: Orchestrated deployment pipeline using Jenkins with master-slave architecture.
4.	Monitoring and Logging: Real-time monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana.
5.	Artifact Management: Centralized artifact storage and versioning with Nexus.

Technical Workflow
1.	Code Management:
o	Source code is stored in GitHub, with version control and branching strategies in place.
2.	CI/CD Pipeline Setup:
o	Jenkins Master-Slave Configuration:
	Jenkins master coordinates build and deployment tasks.
	Slave nodes handle resource-intensive build and deployment operations.
o	Integration with Ansible: Automated configuration of the slave server and Tomcat installation.
3.	Infrastructure Automation:
o	Terraform provisions resources in AWS, including EC2 instances for Jenkins and Tomcat servers.
4.	Build Process:
o	Source code is compiled using Maven, generating a WAR file.
o	The WAR file is uploaded to Nexus as an artifact for version control.
5.	Deployment:
o	The WAR file is deployed to a Tomcat server on the slave node using a Jenkins pipeline.
o	The pipeline ensures zero-downtime deployments by automating pre- and post-deployment checks.
6.	Monitoring:
o	Prometheus collects metrics such as CPU usage, memory utilization, and application latency.
o	Grafana visualizes the metrics and sets up alerts for threshold breaches.

Pipeline Flow
1.	Developer pushes code to GitHub.
2.	Jenkins triggers a build pipeline automatically.
3.	Maven compiles the code and generates a WAR file.
4.	The WAR file is uploaded to Nexus.
5.	Terraform provisions the required infrastructure on AWS.
6.	Ansible sets up the environment, including the Tomcat server.
7.	Jenkins deploys the WAR file to the Tomcat server.
8.	Prometheus collects application and server metrics.
9.	Grafana visualizes the metrics and provides actionable insights.
